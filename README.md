## Introduction
Businesses invest in various customer acquisition strategies to generate revenue. Understanding Customer Lifetime Value helps in identifying valuable customers and optimizing marketing efforts.

## Time Frame Selection
Choosing an appropriate time frame for calculating CLTV is crucial. In this project, a 6-month window is selected based on industry norms and business model considerations.

## Feature Identification
The key features used for predicting future CLTV include:
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores for each customer.

## Data Preparation
The dataset is divided into two parts:
1. **Training Data**: The first 3 months of data.
2. **Testing Data**: The next 6 months of data.

RFM scores are calculated for the training dataset to create a feature set for the prediction model.

## Feature Engineering
### 5.1 Recency
- **Recency Score Calculation**: Customers are scored based on how recently they made a purchase.

### 5.2 Frequency
- **Frequency Score Calculation**: Customers are clustered based on how often they make purchases.

### 5.3 Revenue
- **Revenue Score Calculation**: Customers are clustered based on the total revenue generated.

## Customer Lifetime Value Calculation
Using the formula:
\[ \text{Lifetime Value} = \text{Total Gross Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
the historical lifetime value is calculated for each customer.

## Machine Learning Model Development
- The machine learning model is built using the RFM features and historical CLTV data.
- The model is trained to predict future CLTV based on past behaviors.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness in predicting CLTV.

## Conclusion
The project successfully implements a machine learning model to predict Customer Lifetime Value. Insights gained from the analysis can assist in optimizing customer acquisition strategies and enhancing overall profitability.
